    In a paper published recently, Santo Fortunato insists on the difficulty of designing clustering
    methods for directed networks: "Developing methods of community detection for directed
    graphs is a hard task. For instance, a directed graph is characterized by asymmetrical matrices
    (adjacency matrix, Laplacian, etc.), so spectral analysis is much more complex. Only
    a few methods can be easily extended from the undirected to the directed case. Otherwise,
    the problem must be formulated from scratch" [14].


    According to the classification suggested in [15], clustering methods for directed networks can
    be divided into two categories: density-based and pattern-based clustering.
