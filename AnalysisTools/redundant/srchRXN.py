PURPOSE:
    Find all duplicate reactions in kpp file from kpp warnings. Combine
    all reaction rate constants as sum of individual constants (and
    product for several entries of same kind) and return a dictionary
    'rrate' with:
    - key:      line number of first occurrence of duplicate reaction
    - entry 0:  kpp line of first occurrence up to colon
                (excluding kinetic information)
    - entry 1:  cominded rate constants/j values
    - entry 2:  list of line numbers of all other occurrences of
                this duplicate reaction

    ********************

    PURPOSE:
        Retrieve line numbers of duplicate reactions in kpp file and
        generate dictionary rrate to return to main script rmDUPRXN.
        Also returns kpp file path + name needed to rewrite the re-
        fined kpp file.


    DESCRIPTION:
        retrRXN splits kpp warnings from screen output into segments
        and retrieves information about, which kpp file was used, the
        line numbers of the duplicate reaction, and then generates the
        dictionary rrate with information about the mechanistic and
        kinetic data of the combined reactions and all line numbers
        of the duplicate entries.
        Script files have to be stored in a folder 1 level below main.
        The designated folder is AnalysisTools.
