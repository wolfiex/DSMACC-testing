This module provides Douglas Crockford\textquotesingle{}s J\+S\+ON implementation without modifying any globals.

{\ttfamily stringify} and {\ttfamily parse} are merely exported without respect to whether or not a global {\ttfamily J\+S\+ON} object exists.

\section*{methods }

var json = require(\textquotesingle{}jsonify\textquotesingle{});

\subsection*{json.\+parse(source, reviver) }

Return a new javascript object from a parse of the {\ttfamily source} string.

If a {\ttfamily reviver} function is specified, walk the structure passing each name/value pair to {\ttfamily reviver.\+call(parent, key, value)} to transform the {\ttfamily value} before parsing it.

\subsection*{json.\+stringify(value, replacer, space) }

Return a string representation for {\ttfamily value}.

If {\ttfamily replacer} is specified, walk the structure passing each name/value pair to {\ttfamily replacer.\+call(parent, key, value)} to transform the {\ttfamily value} before stringifying it.

If {\ttfamily space} is a number, indent the result by that many spaces. If {\ttfamily space} is a string, use {\ttfamily space} as the indentation.
