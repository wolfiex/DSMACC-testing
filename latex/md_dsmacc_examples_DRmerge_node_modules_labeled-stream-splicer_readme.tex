\href{https://npmjs.org/package/stream-splicer}{\tt stream splicer} with labels

\href{http://travis-ci.org/browserify/labeled-stream-splicer}{\tt }

\section*{example}

Here\textquotesingle{}s an example that exposes a label for {\ttfamily deps} and {\ttfamily pack}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
var splicer = require('labeled-stream-splicer');
var through = require('through2');
var deps = require('module-deps');
var pack = require('browser-pack');
var lstream = require('lstream');

var pipeline = splicer.obj([
    'deps', [ deps() ],
    'pack', [ pack(\{ raw: true \}) ]
]);

pipeline.get('deps').unshift(lstream());

pipeline.get('deps').push(through.obj(function (row, enc, next) \{
    row.source = row.source.toUpperCase();
    this.push(row);
    next();
\}));

process.stdin.pipe(pipeline).pipe(process.stdout);
\end{DoxyCode}


Here the {\ttfamily deps} sub-\/pipeline is augmented with a post-\/transformation that uppercases its source input.

The A\+PI is the same as \href{https://npmjs.org/package/stream-splicer}{\tt stream-\/splicer}, except that {\ttfamily pipeline.\+get()}, {\ttfamily pipeline.\+splice()}, and {\ttfamily pipeline.\+index\+Of()} can accept string labels in addition to numeric indexes.

\subsection*{var pipeline = splicer(streams, opts)}

Create a {\ttfamily pipeline} duplex stream given an array of {\ttfamily streams}. Each {\ttfamily stream} will be piped to the next. Writes to {\ttfamily pipeline} get written to the first stream and data for reads from {\ttfamily pipeline} come from the last stream.

To signify a label, a stream may have a {\ttfamily .label} property or a string may be placed in the {\ttfamily streams} array.

For example, for streams `\mbox{[} a, \textquotesingle{}foo', b, c, \textquotesingle{}bar\textquotesingle{}, d \mbox{]}\`{}, this pipeline is constructed internally\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
a.pipe(b).pipe(c).pipe(d)
\end{DoxyCode}


with a label {\ttfamily \textquotesingle{}foo}\textquotesingle{} that points to {\ttfamily b} and a label `\textquotesingle{}bar'{\ttfamily that points to}d{\ttfamily . If}a{\ttfamily or}c{\ttfamily has a}.label\`{} property, that label would be used for addressing.

Input will get written into {\ttfamily a}. Output will be read from {\ttfamily d}.

If any of the elements in {\ttfamily streams} are arrays, they will be converted into nested labeled pipelines. This is useful if you want to expose a hookable pipeline with grouped insertion points.

\subsection*{var pipeline = splicer.\+obj(streams, opts)}

Create a {\ttfamily pipeline} with {\ttfamily opts.\+object\+Mode} set to true for convenience.

\subsection*{var removed = pipeline.\+splice(index, how\+Many, stream, ...)}

Splice the pipeline starting at {\ttfamily index}, removing {\ttfamily how\+Many} streams and replacing them with each additional {\ttfamily stream} argument provided.

The streams that were removed from the splice and returned.

{\ttfamily index} can be an integer index or a label.

\subsection*{pipeline.\+push(stream, ...)}

Push one or more streams to the end of the pipeline.

The stream arguments may have a {\ttfamily label} property that will be used for string lookups.

\subsection*{var stream = pipeline.\+pop()}

Pop a stream from the end of the pipeline.

\subsection*{pipeline.\+unshift(stream, ...)}

Unshift one or more streams to the begining of the pipeline.

The stream arguments may have a {\ttfamily label} property that will be used for string lookups.

\subsection*{var stream = pipeline.\+shift()}

Shift a stream from the begining of the pipeline.

\subsection*{var stream = pipeline.\+get(index)}

Return the stream at index {\ttfamily index}.

{\ttfamily index} can be an integer or a string label.
