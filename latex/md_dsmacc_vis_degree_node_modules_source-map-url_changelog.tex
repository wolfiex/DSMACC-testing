\item Changed\+: source\+Mapping\+U\+RL comments used to be matched only when placed at the end of the script. However, since several commonly used Java\+Script libraries do not follow this convention and all popular web browsers accept non-\/trailing comments, this has been revised.

So now non-\/trailing Source\+Mapping\+U\+RL comments are matched as well.

\subsubsection*{Version 0.\+3.\+0 (2014-\/08-\/16)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changed\+: source\+Mapping\+U\+RL comments used to be matched only if they appeared on their own line. However, the spec only says\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
The generated code may include a line at the end of the source, with the following form\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}//# sourceMappingURL=<url>
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \end{quote}


So now they are matched also when they appear on the same line as code.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed\+: The {\ttfamily .set()} method. I couldnâ€™t decide how it should work considering the above change. Moreover, it was unnecessarily complex (and would have gotten worse) for very little gain. It is much easier to run {\ttfamily .remove()} if needed, and then simply {\ttfamily code += \char`\"{}\textbackslash{}n//\# source\+Mapping\+U\+R\+L=\char`\"{} + url} (using the appropriate comment syntax and newline). K\+I\+SS.
\item Changed\+: The {\ttfamily .insert\+Before()} method now always inserts the string exactly before the source\+Mapping\+U\+RL comment; not before the newline before the comment (if any). Moreover, it does not ensure that the comment will be on a new line anymore. This is up to the caller. K\+I\+SS.
\item Changed\+: The {\ttfamily .remove()} method no longer removes the newline before the source\+Mapping\+U\+RL (if any).
\item Changed\+: Renamed {\ttfamily .get()} to {\ttfamily .get\+From()}.
\item Changed\+: Renamed {\ttfamily .remove()} to {\ttfamily .remove\+From()}.
\item Added\+: The {\ttfamily .exists\+In()} method.

\subsubsection*{Version 0.\+2.\+0 (2014-\/02-\/23)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changed\+: A space is no longer inserted before the closing comment syntax. If such a space is desired, it needs to be put in the closing comment syntax itself (such as {\ttfamily \mbox{[}\char`\"{}/$\ast$\char`\"{}, \char`\"{} $\ast$/\char`\"{}\mbox{]}} instead of {\ttfamily \mbox{[}\char`\"{}/$\ast$\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}$\ast$/\char`\"{}\mbox{]}}). (Backwards incompatible change.)
