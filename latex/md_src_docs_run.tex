\paragraph*{Start the Run script. This will open a selection menu showing all available initial conditions files. Please select which one you wish to run.}

$\ast$$\ast$\+Optional flags are\+: $\ast$$\ast$

-\/saved \+: (advanced) runs model using saved versions when -\/modelname is provided

-\/keepx \+: does not ignore runs marked with an X in the beginning

-\/icsonly \+: does not run the model, merely creates an intial conditions file for legacy reasons.


\begin{DoxyCode}
python begin.py
\end{DoxyCode}




\paragraph*{Running Screen}

A progress bar and initialisation conditions have been added for convenience. These should fill up when model is running. If the model stalls for a long period of time, the likelyness is that tuv may not have been compiled properly.



\subsection*{How to run (old doc info)}

Ensure tuv is compiled, if in doubt run {\ttfamily make tuv} should no other error be apparent and the program hangs -\/


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries Create Init cons csv} file in the Init\+Cons directory
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item See (methane.\+csv as a template)
\item Different columns correspond to different runs
\item D\+E\+P\+OS and E\+M\+I\+SS are deposition/emission constants; set concentration rows as 1 to enable, 0 do disable
\item Run names are useful, see existing files as an example.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Run {\ttfamily python begin.\+py}}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item set the number of processes inside this script -\/ the default is 4.
\item This makes the {\ttfamily Init\+\_\+cons.\+dat} as used by D\+S\+M\+A\+CC
\item Run files are generated in the Outputs folder\+: sdout is in run.\+sdout, individual run.\+nc
\item Model output binary is concatenated into a single net\+C\+DF file.
\item To see the form of this have a look inside begin.\+py or read\+\_\+dsmacc.\+py in Analysis\+Tools
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item To view files\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{md_src_docs_view_results}{see this}}
