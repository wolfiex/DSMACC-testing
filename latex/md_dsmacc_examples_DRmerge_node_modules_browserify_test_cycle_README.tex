substack/node-\/browserify\#713 breaks resolving an identical module multiple time from different locations when the module has a circular require.

\subsection*{Reproduce}

Module requires two copies of the same module (identical apart from path) and the sub module has a circular require.

\subsection*{Example}

This is the case with \href{https://github.com/isaacs/readable-stream}{\tt readable-\/stream}. If two different modules depend on the same version readable-\/stream (and no npm dedupe), then both of those modules are required in the same project, browserify throws a {\ttfamily Range\+Error\+: Maximum call stack size exceeded}

See \href{https://github.com/isaacs/readable-stream/blob/master/lib/_stream_writable.js#L134}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/isaacs/readable-\/stream/blob/master/lib/\+\_\+stream\+\_\+writable.\+js\#\+L134} and \href{https://github.com/isaacs/readable-stream/blob/master/lib/_stream_duplex.js#L44}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/isaacs/readable-\/stream/blob/master/lib/\+\_\+stream\+\_\+duplex.\+js\#\+L44}
