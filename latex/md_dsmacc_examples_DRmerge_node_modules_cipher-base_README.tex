Abstract base class to inherit from if you want to create streams implementing the same api as node crypto streams.

Requires you to implement 2 methods {\ttfamily \+\_\+final} and {\ttfamily \+\_\+update}. {\ttfamily \+\_\+update} takes a buffer and should return a buffer, {\ttfamily \+\_\+final} takes no arguments and should return a buffer.

The constructor takes one argument and that is a string which if present switches it into hash mode, i.\+e. the object you get from crypto.\+create\+Hash or crypto.\+create\+Sign, this switches the name of the final method to be the string you passed instead of {\ttfamily final} and returns {\ttfamily this} from update.
