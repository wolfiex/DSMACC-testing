\paragraph*{Generates required f90 files for D\+S\+M\+A\+CC}


\begin{DoxyCode}
make kpp
\end{DoxyCode}
 This opens a list of available kpp files in the mechanisms folder. Select either one, or multiple by supplying a space between each selection.



\paragraph*{If run correctly this should produce no errors.}

Duplicate warnings will run, although may become problematic when trying to select an equation later on. Use the subset selector to eliminate these.



\subsection*{Compiling (old doc)}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries Clear the directory.} If you are just starting or want a clean slate use {\ttfamily make distclean \&\& make new} to clear all. Otherwise you can opt for {\ttfamily make clear or make clean} to remove the .f90/other files
\item {\bfseries Download mechanism} from mcm website and save it in the mechanisms folder. If you wish to compile it with the inorganics.\+kpp for the M\+CM, please include the {\ttfamily \+\_\+organics} tag in the name. All mechanism files require the {\ttfamily .kpp} extention.
\item Emissions/ Deposition may be adjusted . These can be enabled/disabled during runtime with the F\+E\+M\+I\+SS and D\+E\+P\+OS flags in the Initial Conditions.
\item {\bfseries Create model.\+kpp and run kpp using {\ttfamily make kpp}}. Here you shall be tempted to select which mechanism/mechanisms you require.
\item {\bfseries Compile D\+S\+M\+A\+CC} with {\ttfamily make}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If there is an error with the params file, tuv may not have been compiled (ie make new was not run). To fix this type {\ttfamily make tuv} followed by {\ttfamily make}. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
