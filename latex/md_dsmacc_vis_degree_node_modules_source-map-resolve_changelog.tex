\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved\+: Updated the version range of {\ttfamily atob} to disallow depending on {\ttfamily 2.\+0.\+3} which as a \href{https://snyk.io/test/npm/atob/2.0.3?severity=high&severity=medium&severity=low}{\tt security vulnerability}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Version 0.\+5.\+1 (2017-\/10-\/21)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed\+: U\+R\+Ls are now decoded before being passed to {\ttfamily read} in Node.\+js. This allows reading files with spaces, for example.
\item Fixed\+: Missing or empty {\ttfamily sources} fields (such as {\ttfamily sources\+: \mbox{[}\mbox{]}}) in source maps are now handled. Previously, such source maps would cause crashes or callbacks never bing called. Now, an empty result is produced\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
sourcesResolved: [],
sourcesContent: []
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Version 0.\+5.\+0 (2016-\/02-\/28)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved\+: Errors now have a {\ttfamily source\+Map\+Data} property that contain as much as possible of the intended result of the function up until the error occurred.
\item Changed\+: {\ttfamily resolve\+Sources} and {\ttfamily resolve}, as well as their {\ttfamily $\ast$\+Sync} alternatives, no longer fail when one single source fails to be fetched. Instead, the {\ttfamily sources\+Content} array in the result object will contain error objects for all failed sources, and strings otherwise. (Backwards-\/incompatible change.)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Version 0.\+4.\+0 (2015-\/08-\/29)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed\+: The {\ttfamily ignore\+Source\+Root} option of {\ttfamily resolve\+Sources}. It has been replaced with {\ttfamily source\+Root\+: false}. (Backwards-\/incompatible change.)
\item Added\+: The {\ttfamily source\+Root} option of {\ttfamily resolve\+Sources}. It not only allows to ignore the source root, it also lets you replace it.
\item Added\+: The {\ttfamily parse\+Map\+To\+J\+S\+ON} method.
\item Added\+: The {\ttfamily resolve} method now accepts {\ttfamily null, map\+Url, ...} as arguments, in addition to the existing signature, which will read {\ttfamily map\+Url} instead of looking for a source\+Mapping\+U\+RL in the code.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Version 0.\+3.\+1 (2014-\/08-\/16)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved\+: Updated the source-\/map-\/url dependency to 0.\+3.\+0.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Version 0.\+3.\+0 (2014-\/07-\/02)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed\+: Argument checking. It’s not worth it. (Possibly backwards-\/incompatible change.)
\item Added\+: The {\ttfamily source\+Root} property of source maps may now be ignored, which can be useful when resolving sources outside of the browser.
\item Added\+: It is now possible to resolve only the U\+R\+Ls of sources, without reading them.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Version 0.\+2.\+0 (2014-\/06-\/22)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Changed\+: The result of {\ttfamily resolve\+Sources} is now an object, not an array. The old result array is available in the {\ttfamily sources\+Content} property. (Backwards-\/incompatible change.)
\item Changed\+: {\ttfamily sources} has been renamed to {\ttfamily sources\+Content} in the result object of {\ttfamily resolve}. (Backwards-\/incompatible change.)
\item Added\+: {\ttfamily resolve\+Sources} now also returns all sources fully resolved, in the {\ttfamily sources\+Resolved} property.
\item Added\+: The result object of {\ttfamily resolve} now contains the {\ttfamily sources\+Resolved} property from {\ttfamily resolve\+Sources}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Version 0.\+1.\+4 (2014-\/06-\/16)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed\+: {\ttfamily sources\+Content} was mis-\/typed as {\ttfamily source\+Contents}, which meant that the {\ttfamily sources\+Content} property of source maps never was used when resolving sources.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Version 0.\+1.\+3 (2014-\/05-\/06)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Only documentation and meta-\/data changes.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Version 0.\+1.\+2 (2014-\/03-\/23)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved\+: Source maps starting with `)\mbox{]}\}'\`{} are now parsed correctly. The spec allows source maps to start with that character sequence to prevent X\+S\+SI attacks.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Version 0.\+1.\+1 (2014-\/03-\/06)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved\+: Make source\+Root resolving more sensible.

A source root such as {\ttfamily /scripts/subdir} is now treated as {\ttfamily /scripts/subdir/} — that is, as a directory called “subdir”, not a file called “subdir”. Pointing to a file as source root does not makes sense.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Version 0.\+1.\+0 (2014-\/03-\/03)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Initial release. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
