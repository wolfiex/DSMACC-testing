\subsection*{installation}


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm install nugget -g
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{usage}


\begin{DoxyCode}
Usage: nugget <urls> [options]
  -o    output filename
  -d    output parent directory
  -c    resume aborted download
  -f    ignore response codes > 299
  -s    concurrent socket limit (default infinity)
  -q    disable logging
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{examples}


\begin{DoxyCode}
nugget http://foo.com/bar.jpg
# downloads bar.jpg and stores it in the current directory
\end{DoxyCode}


or


\begin{DoxyCode}
nugget http://foo.com/bar.jpg -O baz.jpg
# saves it as baz.jpg. you can also do lowercase -o
\end{DoxyCode}


if you get a status\+Code of 300 or greater nugget will stop. you can force it to stream the response into a file anyway by doing {\ttfamily nugget \href{http://404link.com/file.html}{\tt http\+://404link.\+com/file.\+html} -\/f} or {\ttfamily -\/-\/force} works too

you can also download multiple files, just pass multiple urls\+:



\subsection*{options}

The following options are recognized by nugget\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily -\/s$\vert$-\/-\/sockets} -\/ default Infinity. specify the number of http sockets to use at once (this controls concurrency)
\item {\ttfamily -\/o$\vert$-\/\+O$\vert$-\/-\/out} -\/ specify the filename to write to. this only works if you are downloading a single file
\item {\ttfamily -\/d$\vert$-\/-\/dir} -\/ save files in a directory other than the current one.
\item {\ttfamily -\/c$\vert$-\/-\/continue} -\/ resume downloads if a partially complete target file already exists. If the target file exists and is the same size as the remote file, nothing will be done.
\item {\ttfamily -\/f$\vert$-\/-\/force} -\/ force the server response to be saved to the target file, even if it\textquotesingle{}s a non-\/successful status code.
\item {\ttfamily -\/q$\vert$-\/-\/quiet} -\/ disable logging
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/no-\/strict-\/ssl} -\/ disable strict ssl
\item {\ttfamily -\/-\/proxy} -\/ specify a proxy to use
