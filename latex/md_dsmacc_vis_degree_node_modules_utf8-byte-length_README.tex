Get the utf8 byte length of a string, taking into account multi-\/byte characters and surrogate pairs.

By default, this module defers to {\ttfamily Buffer.\+byte\+Length}. A browser implementation is also provided that doesn\textquotesingle{}t use {\ttfamily Buffer.\+byte\+Length} minimize build size.

\subsection*{Example}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var getLength = require("utf8-byte-length")
console.log(truncate("a☃", 2)) // a = 1 byte, ☃ = 3 bytes
// -> 4
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{A\+PI}

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily var get\+Length = require(\char`\"{}utf8-\/byte-\/length\char`\"{})}}

{\itshape When using browserify or webpack}, this automatically resolves to an implementation that does not use {\ttfamily Buffer.\+byte\+Length}.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily get\+Length(string)}}

Returns the byte length of {\ttfamily string}. Throws an error if {\ttfamily string} is not a string.
