\section*{Introduction}

This protocol is intended to provide a standard way for clients to sign H\+T\+TP requests. R\+F\+C2617 (H\+T\+TP Authentication) defines Basic and Digest authentication mechanisms, and R\+F\+C5246 (T\+LS 1.\+2) defines client-\/auth, both of which are widely employed on the Internet today. However, it is common place that the burdens of P\+KI prevent web service operators from deploying that methodology, and so many fall back to Basic authentication, which has poor security characteristics.

Additionally, O\+Auth provides a fully-\/specified alternative for authorization of web service requests, but is not (always) ideal for machine to machine communication, as the key acquisition steps (generally) imply a fixed infrastructure that may not make sense to a service provider (e.\+g., symmetric keys).

Several web service providers have invented their own schemes for signing H\+T\+TP requests, but to date, none have been placed in the public domain as a standard. This document serves that purpose. There are no techniques in this proposal that are novel beyond previous art, however, this aims to be a simple mechanism for signing these requests.

\section*{Signature Authentication Scheme}

The \char`\"{}signature\char`\"{} authentication scheme is based on the model that the client must authenticate itself with a digital signature produced by either a private asymmetric key (e.\+g., R\+SA) or a shared symmetric key (e.\+g., H\+M\+AC). The scheme is parameterized enough such that it is not bound to any particular key type or signing algorithm. However, it does explicitly assume that clients can send an H\+T\+TP {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classDate}{Date}}} header.

\subsection*{Authorization Header}

The client is expected to send an Authorization header (as defined in R\+FC 2617) with the following parameterization\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}credentials := "Signature" params
params := 1#(keyId | algorithm | [headers] | [ext] | signature)
digitalSignature := plain-string

keyId := "keyId" "=" <"> plain-string <">
algorithm := "algorithm" "=" <"> plain-string <">
headers := "headers" "=" <"> 1#headers-value <">
ext := "ext" "=" <"> plain-string <">
signature := "signature" "=" <"> plain-string <">

headers-value := plain-string
plain-string   = 1*( %x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E )
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Signature Parameters}

\paragraph*{key\+Id}

R\+E\+Q\+U\+I\+R\+ED. The {\ttfamily key\+Id} field is an opaque string that the server can use to look up the component they need to validate the signature. It could be an S\+SH key fingerprint, an L\+D\+AP DN, etc. Management of keys and assignment of {\ttfamily key\+Id} is out of scope for this document.

\paragraph*{algorithm}

R\+E\+Q\+U\+I\+R\+ED. The {\ttfamily algorithm} parameter is used if the client and server agree on a non-\/standard digital signature algorithm. The full list of supported signature mechanisms is listed below.

\paragraph*{headers}

O\+P\+T\+I\+O\+N\+AL. The {\ttfamily headers} parameter is used to specify the list of H\+T\+TP headers used to sign the request. If specified, it should be a quoted list of H\+T\+TP header names, separated by a single space character. By default, only one H\+T\+TP header is signed, which is the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classDate}{Date}}} header. Note that the list M\+U\+ST be specified in the order the values are concatenated together during signing. To include the H\+T\+TP request line in the signature calculation, use the special {\ttfamily request-\/line} value. While this is overloading the definition of {\ttfamily headers} in H\+T\+TP linguism, the request-\/line is defined in R\+FC 2616, and as the outlier from headers in useful signature calculation, it is deemed simpler to simply use {\ttfamily request-\/line} than to add a separate parameter for it.

\paragraph*{extensions}

O\+P\+T\+I\+O\+N\+AL. The {\ttfamily extensions} parameter is used to include additional information which is covered by the request. The content and format of the string is out of scope for this document, and expected to be specified by implementors.

\paragraph*{signature}

R\+E\+Q\+U\+I\+R\+ED. The {\ttfamily signature} parameter is a {\ttfamily Base64} encoded digital signature generated by the client. The client uses the {\ttfamily algorithm} and {\ttfamily headers} request parameters to form a canonicalized {\ttfamily signing string}. This {\ttfamily signing string} is then signed with the key associated with {\ttfamily key\+Id} and the algorithm corresponding to {\ttfamily algorithm}. The {\ttfamily signature} parameter is then set to the {\ttfamily Base64} encoding of the signature.

\subsubsection*{Signing String Composition}

In order to generate the string that is signed with a key, the client M\+U\+ST take the values of each H\+T\+TP header specified by {\ttfamily headers} in the order they appear.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item If the header name is not {\ttfamily request-\/line} then append the lowercased header name followed with an A\+S\+C\+II colon {\ttfamily \+:} and an A\+S\+C\+II space .
\item If the header name is {\ttfamily request-\/line} then append the H\+T\+TP request line, otherwise append the header value.
\item If value is not the last value then append an A\+S\+C\+II newline {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}n}. The string M\+U\+ST N\+OT include a trailing A\+S\+C\+II newline.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\section*{Example Requests}

All requests refer to the following request (body omitted)\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}POST /foo HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2014 20:51:35 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Digest: SHA-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=
Content-Length: 18
\end{DoxyVerb}


The \char`\"{}rsa-\/key-\/1\char`\"{} key\+Id refers to a private key known to the client and a public key known to the server. The \char`\"{}hmac-\/key-\/1\char`\"{} key\+Id refers to key known to the client and server.

\subsection*{Default parameterization}

The authorization header and signature would be generated as\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}Authorization: Signature keyId="rsa-key-1",algorithm="rsa-sha256",signature="Base64(RSA-SHA256(signing string))"
\end{DoxyVerb}


The client would compose the signing string as\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}date: Tue, 07 Jun 2014 20:51:35 GMT
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Header List}

The authorization header and signature would be generated as\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}Authorization: Signature keyId="rsa-key-1",algorithm="rsa-sha256",headers="(request-target) date content-type digest",signature="Base64(RSA-SHA256(signing string))"
\end{DoxyVerb}


The client would compose the signing string as ({\ttfamily + \char`\"{}\textbackslash{}n\char`\"{}} inserted for readability)\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}(request-target) post /foo + "\n"
date: Tue, 07 Jun 2011 20:51:35 GMT + "\n"
content-type: application/json + "\n"
digest: SHA-256=Base64(SHA256(Body))
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Algorithm}

The authorization header and signature would be generated as\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}Authorization: Signature keyId="hmac-key-1",algorithm="hmac-sha1",signature="Base64(HMAC-SHA1(signing string))"
\end{DoxyVerb}


The client would compose the signing string as\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}date: Tue, 07 Jun 2011 20:51:35 GMT
\end{DoxyVerb}


\section*{Signing Algorithms}

Currently supported algorithm names are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item rsa-\/sha1
\item rsa-\/sha256
\item rsa-\/sha512
\item dsa-\/sha1
\item hmac-\/sha1
\item hmac-\/sha256
\item hmac-\/sha512
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Security Considerations}

\subsection*{Default Parameters}

Note the default parameterization of the {\ttfamily Signature} scheme is only safe if all requests are carried over a secure transport (i.\+e., T\+LS). Sending the default scheme over a non-\/secure transport will leave the request vulnerable to spoofing, tampering, replay/repudiation, and integrity violations (if using the S\+T\+R\+I\+DE threat-\/modeling methodology).

\subsection*{Insecure Transports}

If sending the request over plain H\+T\+TP, service providers S\+H\+O\+U\+LD require clients to sign A\+LL H\+T\+TP headers, and the {\ttfamily request-\/line}. Additionally, service providers S\+H\+O\+U\+LD require {\ttfamily Content-\/\+M\+D5} calculations to be performed to ensure against any tampering from clients.

\subsection*{Nonces}

Nonces are out of scope for this document simply because many service providers fail to implement them correctly, or do not adopt security specifications because of the infrastructure complexity. Given the {\ttfamily header} parameterization, a service provider is fully enabled to add nonce semantics into this scheme by using something like an {\ttfamily x-\/request-\/nonce} header, and ensuring it is signed with the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classDate}{Date}}} header.

\subsection*{Clock Skew}

As the default scheme is to sign the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classDate}{Date}}} header, service providers S\+H\+O\+U\+LD protect against logged replay attacks by enforcing a clock skew. The server S\+H\+O\+U\+LD be synchronized with N\+TP, and the recommendation in this specification is to allow 300s of clock skew (in either direction).

\subsection*{Required Headers to Sign}

It is out of scope for this document to dictate what headers a service provider will want to enforce, but service providers S\+H\+O\+U\+LD at minimum include the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classDate}{Date}}} header.

\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Default}

The string to sign would be\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}date: Thu, 05 Jan 2014 21:31:40 GMT
\end{DoxyVerb}


The Authorization header would be\+:

\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{All Headers}

Parameterized to include all headers, the string to sign would be ({\ttfamily + \char`\"{}\textbackslash{}n\char`\"{}} inserted for readability)\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}(request-target): post /foo?param=value&pet=dog

\end{DoxyVerb}


The Authorization header would be\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}Authorization: Signature keyId="Test",algorithm="rsa-sha256",headers="(request-target) host date content-type digest content-length",signature="Ef7MlxLXoBovhil3AlyjtBwAL9g4TN3tibLj7uuNB3CROat/9KaeQ4hW2NiJ+pZ6HQEOx9vYZAyi+7cmIkmJszJCut5kQLAwuX+Ms/mUFvpKlSo9StS2bMXDBNjOh4Auj774GFj4gwjS+3NhFeoqyr/MuN6HsEnkvn6zdgfE2i0="
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Generating and verifying signatures using {\ttfamily openssl}}

The {\ttfamily openssl} commandline tool can be used to generate or verify the signatures listed above.

Compose the signing string as usual, and pipe it into the the {\ttfamily openssl dgst} command, then into {\ttfamily openssl enc -\/base64}, as follows\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ printf 'date: Thu, 05 Jan 2014 21:31:40 GMT' | \
  openssl dgst -binary -sign /path/to/private.pem -sha256 | \
  openssl enc -base64
jKyvPcxB4JbmYY4mByyBY7cZfNl4OW9Hp...
$
\end{DoxyVerb}


The {\ttfamily -\/sha256} option is necessary to produce an {\ttfamily rsa-\/sha256} signature. You can select other hash algorithms such as {\ttfamily sha1} by changing this argument.

To verify a signature, first save the signature data, Base64-\/decoded, into a file, then use {\ttfamily openssl dgst} again with the {\ttfamily -\/verify} option\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ echo 'jKyvPcxB4JbmYY4mByy...' | openssl enc -A -d -base64 > signature
$ printf 'date: Thu, 05 Jan 2014 21:31:40 GMT' | \
  openssl dgst -sha256 -verify /path/to/public.pem -signature ./signature
Verified OK
$
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{Generating and verifying signatures using {\ttfamily sshpk-\/sign}}

You can also generate and check signatures using the {\ttfamily sshpk-\/sign} tool which is included with the {\ttfamily sshpk} package in {\ttfamily npm}.

Compose the signing string as above, and pipe it into {\ttfamily sshpk-\/sign} as follows\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ printf 'date: Thu, 05 Jan 2014 21:31:40 GMT' | \
  sshpk-sign -i /path/to/private.pem
jKyvPcxB4JbmYY4mByyBY7cZfNl4OW9Hp...
$
\end{DoxyVerb}


This will produce an {\ttfamily rsa-\/sha256} signature by default, as you can see using the {\ttfamily -\/v} option\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}sshpk-sign: using rsa-sha256 with a 1024 bit key
\end{DoxyVerb}


You can also use {\ttfamily sshpk-\/verify} in a similar manner\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ printf 'date: Thu, 05 Jan 2014 21:31:40 GMT' | \
  sshpk-verify -i ./public.pem -s 'jKyvPcxB4JbmYY...'
OK
$\end{DoxyVerb}
