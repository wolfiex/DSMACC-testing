This module is used for writing unit tests for your applications, you can access it with `require(\textquotesingle{}assert')\`{}.

It aims to be fully compatibe with the \href{http://nodejs.org/api/assert.html}{\tt node.\+js assert module}, same A\+PI and same behavior, just adding support for web browsers. The A\+PI and code may contain traces of the \href{http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Unit_Testing/1.0}{\tt Common\+JS Unit Testing 1.\+0 spec} which they were based on, but both have evolved significantly since then.

A {\ttfamily strict} and a {\ttfamily legacy} mode exist, while it is recommended to only use {\ttfamily strict mode}.

\subsection*{Strict mode}

When using the {\ttfamily strict mode}, any {\ttfamily assert} function will use the equality used in the strict function mode. So {\ttfamily assert.\+deep\+Equal()} will, for example, work the same as {\ttfamily assert.\+deep\+Strict\+Equal()}.

It can be accessed using\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
const assert = require('assert').strict;
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Legacy mode}

\begin{quote}
Deprecated\+: Use strict mode instead. \end{quote}


When accessing {\ttfamily assert} directly instead of using the {\ttfamily strict} property, the \href{https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-abstract-equality-comparison}{\tt Abstract Equality Comparison} will be used for any function without a \char`\"{}strict\char`\"{} in its name (e.\+g. {\ttfamily assert.\+deep\+Equal()}).

It can be accessed using\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
const assert = require('assert');
\end{DoxyCode}


It is recommended to use the {\ttfamily strict mode} instead as the Abstract Equality Comparison can often have surprising results. Especially in case of {\ttfamily assert.\+deep\+Equal()} as the used comparison rules there are very lax.

E.\+g.


\begin{DoxyCode}
// WARNING: This does not throw an AssertionError!
assert.deepEqual(/a/gi, new Date());
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{assert.\+fail(actual, expected, message, operator)}

Throws an exception that displays the values for actual and expected separated by the provided operator.

\subsection*{assert(value, message), assert.\+ok(value, \mbox{[}message\mbox{]})}

Tests if value is truthy, it is equivalent to assert.\+equal(true, !!value, message);

\subsection*{assert.\+equal(actual, expected, \mbox{[}message\mbox{]})}

Tests shallow, coercive equality with the equal comparison operator ( == ).

\subsection*{assert.\+not\+Equal(actual, expected, \mbox{[}message\mbox{]})}

Tests shallow, coercive non-\/equality with the not equal comparison operator ( != ).

\subsection*{assert.\+deep\+Equal(actual, expected, \mbox{[}message\mbox{]})}

Tests for deep equality.

\subsection*{assert.\+deep\+Strict\+Equal(actual, expected, \mbox{[}message\mbox{]})}

Tests for deep equality, as determined by the strict equality operator ( === )

\subsection*{assert.\+not\+Deep\+Equal(actual, expected, \mbox{[}message\mbox{]})}

Tests for any deep inequality.

\subsection*{assert.\+strict\+Equal(actual, expected, \mbox{[}message\mbox{]})}

Tests strict equality, as determined by the strict equality operator ( === )

\subsection*{assert.\+not\+Strict\+Equal(actual, expected, \mbox{[}message\mbox{]})}

Tests strict non-\/equality, as determined by the strict not equal operator ( !== )

\subsection*{assert.\+throws(block, \mbox{[}error\mbox{]}, \mbox{[}message\mbox{]})}

Expects block to throw an error. error can be constructor, regexp or validation function.

Validate instanceof using constructor\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
assert.throws(function() \{ throw new Error("Wrong value"); \}, Error);
\end{DoxyCode}


Validate error message using Reg\+Exp\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
assert.throws(function() \{ throw new Error("Wrong value"); \}, /value/);
\end{DoxyCode}


Custom error validation\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
assert.throws(function() \{
    throw new Error("Wrong value");
\}, function(err) \{
    if ( (err instanceof Error) && /value/.test(err) ) \{
        return true;
    \}
\}, "unexpected error");
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{assert.\+does\+Not\+Throw(block, \mbox{[}message\mbox{]})}

Expects block not to throw an error, see assert.\+throws for details.

\subsection*{assert.\+if\+Error(value)}

Tests if value is not a false value, throws if it is a true value. Useful when testing the first argument, error in callbacks.
