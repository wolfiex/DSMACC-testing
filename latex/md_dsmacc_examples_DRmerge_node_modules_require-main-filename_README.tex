\href{https://travis-ci.org/yargs/require-main-filename}{\tt } \href{https://coveralls.io/r/yargs/require-main-filename?branch=master}{\tt } \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/require-main-filename}{\tt }

{\ttfamily require.\+main.\+filename} is great for figuring out the entry point for the current application. This can be combined with a module like \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg-conf}{\tt pkg-\/conf} to, {\itshape as if by magic}, load top-\/level configuration.

Unfortunately, {\ttfamily require.\+main.\+filename} sometimes fails when an application is executed with an alternative process manager, e.\+g., \href{https://github.com/tjanczuk/iisnode}{\tt iisnode}.

{\ttfamily require-\/main-\/filename} is a shim that addresses this problem.

\subsection*{Usage}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var main = require('require-main-filename')()
// use main as an alternative to require.main.filename.
\end{DoxyCode}
