{\ttfamily require(\textquotesingle{}process\textquotesingle{});} just like any other module.

Works in node.\+js and browsers via the browser.\+js shim provided with the module.

\subsection*{browser implementation}

The goal of this module is not to be a full-\/fledged alternative to the builtin process module. This module mostly exists to provide the next\+Tick functionality and little more. We keep this module lean because it will often be included by default by tools like browserify when it detects a module has used the {\ttfamily process} global.

It also exposes a \char`\"{}browser\char`\"{} member (i.\+e. {\ttfamily process.\+browser}) which is {\ttfamily true} in this implementation but {\ttfamily undefined} in node. This can be used in isomorphic code that adjusts it\textquotesingle{}s behavior depending on which environment it\textquotesingle{}s running in.

If you are looking to provide other process methods, I suggest you monkey patch them onto the process global in your app. A list of user created patches is below.

\subsection*{package manager notes}

If you are writing a bundler to package modules for client side use, make sure you use the {\ttfamily browser} field hint in package.\+json.

See \href{https://gist.github.com/4339901}{\tt https\+://gist.\+github.\+com/4339901} for details.

The \href{https://github.com/substack/node-browserify}{\tt browserify} module will properly handle this field when bundling your files.
