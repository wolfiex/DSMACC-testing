A fork of the nytimes \href{http://nytimes.github.io/svg-crowbar/}{\tt svg-\/crowbar} bookmarklet that extracts S\+VG nodes and accompanying styles from an H\+T\+ML document and downloads them as an S\+VG file --- A file which you could open and edit in Adobe Illustrator, for instance. Because S\+V\+Gs are resolution independent, itâ€™s great for when you want to use web technologies to create documents that are meant to be printed (like, maybe on newsprint). It was created with \href{https://d3js.org}{\tt d3.\+js} in mind, but it should work fine no matter how you choose to generate your S\+VG.
