Adds support for the {\ttfamily timers} module to browserify.

\subsection*{Wait, isn\textquotesingle{}t it already supported in the browser?}

The public methods of the {\ttfamily timers} module are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily set\+Timeout(callback, delay, \mbox{[}arg\mbox{]}, \mbox{[}...\mbox{]})}
\item {\ttfamily clear\+Timeout(timeout\+Id)}
\item {\ttfamily set\+Interval(callback, delay, \mbox{[}arg\mbox{]}, \mbox{[}...\mbox{]})}
\item {\ttfamily clear\+Interval(interval\+Id)}
\end{DoxyItemize}

and indeed, browsers support these already.

\subsection*{So, why does this exist?}

The {\ttfamily timers} module also includes some private methods used in other built-\/in Node.\+js modules\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily enroll(item, delay)}
\item {\ttfamily unenroll(item)}
\item {\ttfamily active(item)}
\end{DoxyItemize}

These are used to efficiently support a large quantity of timers with the same timeouts by creating only a few timers under the covers.

Node.\+js also offers the {\ttfamily immediate} A\+P\+Is, which aren\textquotesingle{}t yet available cross-\/browser, so we polyfill those\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily set\+Immediate(callback, \mbox{[}arg\mbox{]}, \mbox{[}...\mbox{]})}
\item {\ttfamily clear\+Immediate(immediate\+Id)}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{I need lots of timers and want to use linked list timers as Node.\+js does.}

Linked lists are efficient when you have thousands (millions?) of timers with the same delay. Take a look at \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/timers-browserify-full}{\tt timers-\/browserify-\/full} in this case.
