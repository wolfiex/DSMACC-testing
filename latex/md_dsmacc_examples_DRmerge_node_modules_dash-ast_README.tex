\subsection*{Install}


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm install dash-ast
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Usage}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var dashAst = require('dash-ast')
var isIdentifier = require('estree-is-identifier')

var deps = []
dashAst(ast, function (node, parent) \{
  if (node.type === 'CallExpression' && isIdentifier(node.callee, 'require')) \{
    deps.push(node.arguments[0])
  \}
\})
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{A\+PI}

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily dash\+Ast(ast, callback)}}

Call {\ttfamily callback(node, parent)} on each node in {\ttfamily ast}. This does a preorder traversal, i.\+e. {\ttfamily callback} receives child nodes {\itshape after} the parent node.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily dash\+Ast(ast, \{ enter, leave \})}}

Call {\ttfamily enter(node, parent)} on each node in {\ttfamily ast} before traversing its children, and call {\ttfamily leave(enter, parent)} on each node {\itshape after} traversing its children. If a node does not have children, {\ttfamily enter()} and {\ttfamily leave()} are called immediately after each other.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily dash\+Ast.\+with\+Parent(ast, callback)}}

Call {\ttfamily callback(node)} on each node in {\ttfamily ast}. This does a preorder traversal, i.\+e. {\ttfamily callback} receives child nodes {\itshape after} the parent node. Each {\ttfamily node} has an additional property {\ttfamily node.\+parent} referring to the parent node.

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily dash\+Ast.\+with\+Parent(ast, \{ enter, leave \})}}

Call {\ttfamily enter(node, parent)} on each node in {\ttfamily ast} before traversing its children, and call {\ttfamily leave(enter, parent)} on each node {\itshape after} traversing its children. If a node does not have children, {\ttfamily enter()} and {\ttfamily leave()} are called immediately after each other. Each {\ttfamily node} has an additional property {\ttfamily node.\+parent} referring to the parent node.
