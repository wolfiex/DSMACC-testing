Published at I\+C\+LR 2019.

\subsection*{Run the code}

The easiest way to get started is by looking at the notebook {\ttfamily simple\+\_\+example\+\_\+tensorflow.\+ipynb} or {\ttfamily simple\+\_\+example\+\_\+pytorch.\+ipynb}. The notebook {\ttfamily reproduce\+\_\+results.\+ipynb} shows how to reproduce the results from the paper.

\subsection*{Requirements}

The repository uses these packages\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
numpy
scipy
tensorflow
pytorch
\end{DoxyCode}


You can install all requirements via {\ttfamily pip install -\/r requirements.\+txt}. However, in practice you will only need either Tensor\+Flow or Py\+Torch, depending on which implementation you use. If you use the {\ttfamily networkx\+\_\+to\+\_\+sparsegraph} method for importing other datasets you will additionally need NetworkX.

\subsection*{Installation}

To install the package, run {\ttfamily python setup.\+py install}.

\subsection*{Datasets}

In the {\ttfamily data} folder you can find several datasets. If you want to use other (external) datasets, you can e.\+g. use the {\ttfamily networkx\+\_\+to\+\_\+sparsegraph} method in {\ttfamily ppnp.\+data.\+io} for converting NetworkX graphs to our Sparse\+Graph format.
