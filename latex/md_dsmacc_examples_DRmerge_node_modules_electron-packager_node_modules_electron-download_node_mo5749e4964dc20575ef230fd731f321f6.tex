\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily srcpath} {\ttfamily $<$String$>$}
\item {\ttfamily dstpath} {\ttfamily $<$String$>$}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Example\+:}


\begin{DoxyCode}
const fs = require('fs-extra')

const srcpath = '/tmp/file.txt'
const dstpath = '/tmp/this/path/does/not/exist/file.txt'
fs.ensureLinkSync(srcpath, dstpath)
// link has now been created, including the directory it is to be placed in
\end{DoxyCode}
