\#through

\href{http://travis-ci.org/dominictarr/through}{\tt } \href{https://ci.testling.com/dominictarr/through}{\tt }

Easy way to create a {\ttfamily Stream} that is both {\ttfamily readable} and {\ttfamily writable}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Pass in optional {\ttfamily write} and {\ttfamily end} methods.
\item {\ttfamily through} takes care of pause/resume logic if you use {\ttfamily this.\+queue(data)} instead of `this.\+emit(\textquotesingle{}data', data){\ttfamily .}
\item {\ttfamily Use}this.\+pause(){\ttfamily and}this.\+resume(){\ttfamily to manage flow.}
\item {\ttfamily Check}this.\+paused$<$tt$>$to see current flow state. (write{\ttfamily always returns}!this.paused\`{}).
\end{DoxyItemize}

This function is the basis for most of the synchronous streams in \href{http://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream}{\tt event-\/stream}.


\begin{DoxyCode}
var through = require('through')

through(function write(data) \{
    this.queue(data) //data *must* not be null
  \},
  function end () \{ //optional
    this.queue(null)
  \})
\end{DoxyCode}


Or, can also be used {\itshape without} buffering on pause, use `this.\+emit(\textquotesingle{}data', data)`, and this.\+emit(\textquotesingle{}end')


\begin{DoxyCode}
var through = require('through')

through(function write(data) \{
    this.emit('data', data)
    //this.pause() 
  \},
  function end () \{ //optional
    this.emit('end')
  \})
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Extended Options}

You will probably not need these 99\% of the time.

\subsubsection*{auto\+Destroy=false}

By default, {\ttfamily through} emits close when the writable and readable side of the stream has ended. If that is not desired, set {\ttfamily auto\+Destroy=false}.


\begin{DoxyCode}
var through = require('through')

//like this
var ts = through(write, end, \{autoDestroy: false\})
//or like this
var ts = through(write, end)
ts.autoDestroy = false
\end{DoxyCode}
