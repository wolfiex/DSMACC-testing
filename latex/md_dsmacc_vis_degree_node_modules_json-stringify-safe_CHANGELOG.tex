\item Fixes stringify to only take ancestors into account when checking circularity. ~\newline
 It previously assumed every visited object was circular which led to \href{https://github.com/isaacs/json-stringify-safe/issues/9}{\tt false positives}. ~\newline
 Uses the tiny serializer I wrote for \href{https://github.com/moll/js-must}{\tt Must.\+js} a year and a half ago.
\item Fixes calling the {\ttfamily replacer} function in the proper context ({\ttfamily this\+Arg}).
\item Fixes calling the {\ttfamily cycle\+Replacer} function in the proper context ({\ttfamily this\+Arg}).
\item Speeds serializing by a factor of Big-\/O(h-\/my-\/god-\/it-\/linearly-\/searched-\/every-\/object) it had ever seen. Searching only the ancestors for a circular references speeds up things considerably.
