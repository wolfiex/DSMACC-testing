Run multiple promise-\/returning \& async functions with limited concurrency \end{quote}


\subsection*{Install}


\begin{DoxyCode}
$ npm install p-limit
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Usage}


\begin{DoxyCode}
const pLimit = require('p-limit');

const limit = pLimit(1);

const input = [
    limit(() => fetchSomething('foo')),
    limit(() => fetchSomething('bar')),
    limit(() => doSomething())
];

(async () => \{
    // Only one promise is run at once
    const result = await Promise.all(input);
    console.log(result);
\})();
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{A\+PI}

\subsubsection*{p\+Limit(concurrency)}

Returns a {\ttfamily limit} function.

\paragraph*{concurrency}

Type\+: {\ttfamily number}~\newline
 Minimum\+: {\ttfamily 1}~\newline
 Default\+: {\ttfamily Infinity}

Concurrency limit.

\subsubsection*{limit(fn, ...args)}

Returns the promise returned by calling {\ttfamily fn(...args)}.

\paragraph*{fn}

Type\+: {\ttfamily Function}

Promise-\/returning/async function.

\paragraph*{args}

Any arguments to pass through to {\ttfamily fn}.

Support for passing arguments on to the {\ttfamily fn} is provided in order to be able to avoid creating unnecessary closures. You probably don\textquotesingle{}t need this optimization unless you\textquotesingle{}re pushing a {\itshape lot} of functions.

\subsubsection*{limit.\+active\+Count}

The number of promises that are currently running.

\subsubsection*{limit.\+pending\+Count}

The number of promises that are waiting to run (i.\+e. their internal {\ttfamily fn} was not called yet).

\subsection*{F\+AQ}

\subsubsection*{How is this different from the \href{https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-queue}{\tt {\ttfamily p-\/queue}} package?}

This package is only about limiting the number of concurrent executions, while {\ttfamily p-\/queue} is a fully featured queue implementation with lots of different options, introspection, and ability to pause and clear the queue.
