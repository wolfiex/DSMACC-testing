This library provides the functionality of P\+B\+K\+D\+F2 with the ability to use any supported hashing algorithm returned from {\ttfamily crypto.\+get\+Hashes()}

\subsection*{Usage}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var pbkdf2 = require('pbkdf2')
var derivedKey = pbkdf2.pbkdf2Sync('password', 'salt', 1, 32, 'sha512')

...
\end{DoxyCode}


For more information on the A\+PI, please see the relevant \href{https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_pbkdf2_password_salt_iterations_keylen_digest_callback}{\tt Node documentation}.

For high performance, use the {\ttfamily async} variant ({\ttfamily pbkdf2.\+pbkdf2}), not {\ttfamily pbkdf2.\+pbkdf2\+Sync}, this variant has the oppurtunity to use {\ttfamily window.\+crypto.\+subtle} when browserified.
