set blocking {\ttfamily stdio} and {\ttfamily stderr} ensuring that terminal output does not truncate.


\begin{DoxyCode}
const setBlocking = require('set-blocking')
setBlocking(true)
console.log(someLargeStringToOutput)
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Historical Context/\+Word of Warning}

This was created as a shim to address the bug discussed in \href{https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/6456}{\tt node \#6456}. This bug crops up on newer versions of Node.\+js ({\ttfamily 0.\+12+}), truncating terminal output.

You should be mindful of the side-\/effects caused by using {\ttfamily set-\/blocking}\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item if your module sets blocking to {\ttfamily true}, it will effect other modules consuming your library. In \href{https://github.com/yargs/yargs/blob/master/yargs.js#L653}{\tt yargs} we only call {\ttfamily set\+Blocking(true)} once we already know we are about to call {\ttfamily process.\+exit(code)}.
\item this patch will not apply to subprocesses spawned with {\ttfamily is\+T\+TY = true}, this is the \href{https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options}{\tt default {\ttfamily spawn()} behavior}.
