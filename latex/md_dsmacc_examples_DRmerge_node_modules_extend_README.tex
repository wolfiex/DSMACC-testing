\section*{extend() for Node.\+js \textsuperscript{\href{https://npmjs.org/package/extend}{\tt }}}

{\ttfamily node-\/extend} is a port of the classic extend() method from j\+Query. It behaves as you expect. It is simple, tried and true.

Notes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Since Node.\+js $>$= 4, \href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign}{\tt {\ttfamily Object.\+assign}} now offers the same functionality natively (but without the \char`\"{}deep copy\char`\"{} option). See \href{https://nodejs.org/en/docs/es6}{\tt E\+C\+M\+A\+Script 2015 (E\+S6) in Node.\+js}.
\item Some native implementations of {\ttfamily Object.\+assign} in both Node.\+js and many browsers (since N\+PM modules are for the browser too) may not be fully spec-\/compliant. Check \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/object.assign}{\tt {\ttfamily object.\+assign}} module for a compliant candidate.

\subsection*{Installation}

This package is available on \href{https://npmjs.org/package/extend}{\tt npm} as\+: {\ttfamily extend}


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm install extend
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Usage}

{\bfseries Syntax\+:} extend $\ast$$\ast$($\ast$$\ast$ \mbox{[}{\ttfamily deep}\mbox{]}, {\ttfamily target}, {\ttfamily object1}, \mbox{[}{\ttfamily objectN}\mbox{]} $\ast$$\ast$)$\ast$$\ast$

{\itshape Extend one object with one or more others, returning the modified object.}

{\bfseries Example\+:}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var extend = require('extend');
extend(targetObject, object1, object2);
\end{DoxyCode}


Keep in mind that the target object will be modified, and will be returned from extend().

If a boolean true is specified as the first argument, extend performs a deep copy, recursively copying any objects it finds. Otherwise, the copy will share structure with the original object(s). Undefined properties are not copied. However, properties inherited from the object\textquotesingle{}s prototype will be copied over. Warning\+: passing {\ttfamily false} as the first argument is not supported.

\subsubsection*{Arguments}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily deep} {\itshape Boolean} (optional) If set, the merge becomes recursive (i.\+e. deep copy).
\item {\ttfamily target} {\itshape Object} The object to extend.
\item {\ttfamily object1} {\itshape Object} The object that will be merged into the first.
\item {\ttfamily objectN} {\itshape Object} (Optional) More objects to merge into the first.
\end{DoxyItemize}
