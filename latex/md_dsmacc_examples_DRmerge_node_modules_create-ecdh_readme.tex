In io.\+js or node $>$= 0.\+11 this module is just a shortcut to crypto.\+create\+E\+C\+DH. In node $<$= 0.\+11 or the browser this is a pure Java\+Script implimentation, more specifically a wrapper around \href{https://github.com/indutny/elliptic}{\tt elliptic}, to give it the same A\+PI as node. {\ttfamily secp256k1}, {\ttfamily secp224r1} (aka p224), {\ttfamily prime256v1} (aka p256, secp256r1), {\ttfamily prime192v1} (aka p192, secp192r1), {\ttfamily secp384r1} (aka p384), {\ttfamily secp521r1} (aka p521) curves all work in both this library and node (though only the highlighted name will work in node).
