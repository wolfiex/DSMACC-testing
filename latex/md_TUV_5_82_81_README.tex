This is an updated T\+UV 5.\+2 version with additional photoreactions for the use with the D\+S\+M\+A\+CC model version available at \href{https://github.com/pb866/DSMACC-testing.git}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/pb866/\+D\+S\+M\+A\+C\+C-\/testing.\+git}. T\+UV 5.\+2.\+1 is designed for a new G\+E\+C\+K\+O-\/\+A/\+M\+CM photolysis protocol, which will become available soon.

\section*{Getting started }

\item Download/clone D\+S\+M\+A\+CC from {\ttfamily \href{https://github.com/pb866/DSMACC-testing.git}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/pb866/\+D\+S\+M\+A\+C\+C-\/testing.\+git}}.
\item Copy all content to a folder named {\ttfamily T\+U\+V\+\_\+5.\+2.\+1} in the D\+S\+M\+A\+CC main folder.
\item compiled T\+UV from the D\+S\+M\+A\+CC main folder by running the D\+S\+M\+A\+CC make command {\ttfamily make tuv}
