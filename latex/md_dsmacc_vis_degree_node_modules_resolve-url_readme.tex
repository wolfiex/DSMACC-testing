\section*{Installation }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily npm install resolve-\/url}
\item {\ttfamily bower install resolve-\/url}
\item {\ttfamily component install lydell/resolve-\/url}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Works with Common\+JS, A\+MD and browser globals, through U\+MD.

\section*{Usage }

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily resolve\+Url(...urls)}}

Pass one or more urls. Resolves the last one to an absolute url, using the previous ones and {\ttfamily window.\+location}.

It’s like starting out on {\ttfamily window.\+location}, and then clicking links with the urls as {\ttfamily href} attributes in order, from left to right.

Unlike Node.\+js’ \href{http://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_resolve_from_to}{\tt {\ttfamily path.\+resolve}}, this function always goes through all of the arguments, from left to right. {\ttfamily path.\+resolve} goes from right to left and only in the worst case goes through them all. Should that matter.

Actually, the function is {\itshape really} like clicking a lot of links in series\+: An actual {\ttfamily $<$a$>$} gets its {\ttfamily href} attribute set for each url! This means that the url resolution of the browser is used, which makes this module really light-\/weight.

Also note that this functions deals with urls, not paths, so in that respect it has more in common with Node.\+js’ \href{http://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_url_resolve_from_to}{\tt {\ttfamily url.\+resolve}}. But the arguments are more like \href{http://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_resolve_from_to}{\tt {\ttfamily path.\+resolve}}.

\section*{Tests }

Run {\ttfamily npm test}, which lints the code and then gives you a link to open in a browser of choice (using {\ttfamily testling}).
