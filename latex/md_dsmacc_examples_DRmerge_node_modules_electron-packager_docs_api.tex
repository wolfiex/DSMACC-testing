The regular expressions are matched against the absolute path of a given file/directory to be copied.

The following paths are always ignored ({\itshape when you aren\textquotesingle{}t using the predicate function that is described after the list})\+:

Alternatively, this can be a predicate function that, given an absolute file path, returns {\ttfamily true} if the file should be ignored, or {\ttfamily false} if the file should be kept. {\itshape This does not use any of the default ignored directories listed above.}

\subparagraph*{{\ttfamily name}}
