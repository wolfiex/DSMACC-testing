Like {\ttfamily mkdir -\/p}, but in node.\+js!

\href{http://travis-ci.org/substack/node-mkdirp}{\tt }

\section*{example}

\subsection*{pow.\+js}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var mkdirp = require('mkdirp');

mkdirp('/tmp/foo/bar/baz', function (err) \{
    if (err) console.error(err)
    else console.log('pow!')
\});
\end{DoxyCode}


Output


\begin{DoxyCode}
pow!
\end{DoxyCode}


And now /tmp/foo/bar/baz exists, huzzah!

\section*{methods}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var mkdirp = require('mkdirp');
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{mkdirp(dir, opts, cb)}

Create a new directory and any necessary subdirectories at {\ttfamily dir} with octal permission string {\ttfamily opts.\+mode}. If {\ttfamily opts} is a non-\/object, it will be treated as the {\ttfamily opts.\+mode}.

If {\ttfamily opts.\+mode} isn\textquotesingle{}t specified, it defaults to {\ttfamily 0777 \& ($\sim$process.umask())}.

{\ttfamily cb(err, made)} fires with the error or the first directory {\ttfamily made} that had to be created, if any.

You can optionally pass in an alternate {\ttfamily fs} implementation by passing in {\ttfamily opts.\+fs}. Your implementation should have {\ttfamily opts.\+fs.\+mkdir(path, mode, cb)} and {\ttfamily opts.\+fs.\+stat(path, cb)}.

\subsection*{mkdirp.\+sync(dir, opts)}

Synchronously create a new directory and any necessary subdirectories at {\ttfamily dir} with octal permission string {\ttfamily opts.\+mode}. If {\ttfamily opts} is a non-\/object, it will be treated as the {\ttfamily opts.\+mode}.

If {\ttfamily opts.\+mode} isn\textquotesingle{}t specified, it defaults to {\ttfamily 0777 \& ($\sim$process.umask())}.

Returns the first directory that had to be created, if any.

You can optionally pass in an alternate {\ttfamily fs} implementation by passing in {\ttfamily opts.\+fs}. Your implementation should have {\ttfamily opts.\+fs.\+mkdir\+Sync(path, mode)} and {\ttfamily opts.\+fs.\+stat\+Sync(path)}.

\section*{usage}

This package also ships with a {\ttfamily mkdirp} command.


\begin{DoxyCode}
usage: mkdirp [DIR1,DIR2..] \{OPTIONS\}

  Create each supplied directory including any necessary parent directories that
  don't yet exist.

  If the directory already exists, do nothing.

OPTIONS are:

  -m, --mode   If a directory needs to be created, set the mode as an octal
               permission string.
\end{DoxyCode}
