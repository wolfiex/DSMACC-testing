This module ports Chromium\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Pickle} class to \mbox{\hyperlink{classNode}{Node}}, see {\ttfamily Pickle}\textquotesingle{}s header for introduction\+:

\begin{quote}
This class provides facilities for basic binary value packing and unpacking.

The Pickle class supports appending primitive values (ints, strings, etc.) to a pickle instance. The Pickle instance grows its internal memory buffer dynamically to hold the sequence of primitive values. The internal memory buffer is exposed as the \char`\"{}data\char`\"{} of the Pickle. This \char`\"{}data\char`\"{} can be passed to a Pickle object to initialize it for reading.

When reading from a Pickle object, it is important for the consumer to know what value types to read and in what order to read them as the Pickle does not keep track of the type of data written to it.

The Pickle\textquotesingle{}s data has a header which contains the size of the Pickle\textquotesingle{}s payload. It can optionally support additional space in the header. That space is controlled by the header\+\_\+size parameter passed to the Pickle constructor. \end{quote}


\subsection*{Install}


\begin{DoxyCode}
$ npm install chromium-pickle-js
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Usage}

\subsubsection*{create\+Empty()}

Returns an empty {\ttfamily Pickle} object.

\subsubsection*{create\+From\+Buffer(buffer)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily buffer} Buffer
\end{DoxyItemize}

Returns a {\ttfamily Pickle} object that initialized from a {\ttfamily buffer}. The data is not copied so you have to ensure the {\ttfamily buffer} lives when using the Pickle object, and you should never modify the Pickle object created this way.

\subsubsection*{Pickle.\+create\+Iterator()}

Returns a {\ttfamily Pickle\+Iterator} object that can be used to read data from this {\ttfamily Pickle} object.

\subsubsection*{Pickle.\+to\+Buffer()}

Returns a {\ttfamily Buffer} object that contains this {\ttfamily Pickle} object\textquotesingle{}s data.

\subsubsection*{Pickle.\+write\+Bool(value)}

Writes {\ttfamily value} to {\ttfamily Pickle} object as {\ttfamily bool}. Returns {\ttfamily true} when succeeded and returns {\ttfamily false} when failed.

\subsubsection*{Pickle.\+write\+Int(value)}

Writes {\ttfamily value} to {\ttfamily Pickle} object as {\ttfamily int}. Returns {\ttfamily true} when succeeded and returns {\ttfamily false} when failed.

\subsubsection*{Pickle.\+write\+U\+Int32(value)}

Writes {\ttfamily value} to {\ttfamily Pickle} object as {\ttfamily uint32}. Returns {\ttfamily true} when succeeded and returns {\ttfamily false} when failed.

\subsubsection*{Pickle.\+write\+Int64(value)}

Writes {\ttfamily value} to {\ttfamily Pickle} object as {\ttfamily int64}. Returns {\ttfamily true} when succeeded and returns {\ttfamily false} when failed.

\subsubsection*{Pickle.\+write\+U\+Int64(value)}

Writes {\ttfamily value} to {\ttfamily Pickle} object as {\ttfamily uint64}. Returns {\ttfamily true} when succeeded and returns {\ttfamily false} when failed.

\subsubsection*{Pickle.\+write\+Float(value)}

Writes {\ttfamily value} to {\ttfamily Pickle} object as {\ttfamily float}. Returns {\ttfamily true} when succeeded and returns {\ttfamily false} when failed.

\subsubsection*{Pickle.\+write\+Double(value)}

Writes {\ttfamily value} to {\ttfamily Pickle} object as {\ttfamily Double}. Returns {\ttfamily true} when succeeded and returns {\ttfamily false} when failed.

\subsubsection*{Pickle.\+write\+String(str)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily str} String
\end{DoxyItemize}

Writes {\ttfamily str} to {\ttfamily Pickle} object. Returns {\ttfamily true} when succeeded and returns {\ttfamily false} when failed.

\subsubsection*{Pickle\+Iterator.\+read\+Bool()}

Returns current value as {\ttfamily bool} and seeks to next data. A{\ttfamily Type\+Error} exception would be thrown when failed.

\subsubsection*{Pickle\+Iterator.\+read\+Int()}

Returns current value as {\ttfamily int} and seeks to next data. A{\ttfamily Type\+Error} exception would be thrown when failed.

\subsubsection*{Pickle\+Iterator.\+read\+U\+Int32()}

Returns current value as {\ttfamily uint32} and seeks to next data. A{\ttfamily Type\+Error} exception would be thrown when failed.

\subsubsection*{Pickle\+Iterator.\+read\+Int64()}

Returns current value as {\ttfamily int64} and seeks to next data. A{\ttfamily Type\+Error} exception would be thrown when failed.

\subsubsection*{Pickle\+Iterator.\+read\+U\+Int64()}

Returns current value as {\ttfamily uint64} and seeks to next data. A{\ttfamily Type\+Error} exception would be thrown when failed.

\subsubsection*{Pickle\+Iterator.\+read\+Float()}

Returns current value as {\ttfamily float} and seeks to next data. A{\ttfamily Type\+Error} exception would be thrown when failed.

\subsubsection*{Pickle\+Iterator.\+read\+Double()}

Returns current value as {\ttfamily double} and seeks to next data. A{\ttfamily Type\+Error} exception would be thrown when failed.

\subsubsection*{Pickle\+Iterator.\+read\+String()}

Returns current value as {\ttfamily String} and seeks to next data. A{\ttfamily Type\+Error} exception would be thrown when failed.
