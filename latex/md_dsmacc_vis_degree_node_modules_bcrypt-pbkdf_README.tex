Port of the Open\+B\+SD {\ttfamily bcrypt\+\_\+pbkdf} function to pure Javascript. {\ttfamily npm}-\/ified version of \href{https://github.com/devi/tmp/blob/master/js/bcrypt_pbkdf.js}{\tt Devi Mandiri\textquotesingle{}s port}, with some minor performance improvements. The code is copied verbatim (and un-\/styled) from Devi\textquotesingle{}s work.

This product includes software developed by Niels Provos.

\subsection*{A\+PI}

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily bcrypt\+\_\+pbkdf.\+pbkdf(pass, passlen, salt, saltlen, key, keylen, rounds)}}

Derive a cryptographic key of arbitrary length from a given password and salt, using the Open\+B\+SD {\ttfamily bcrypt\+\_\+pbkdf} function. This is a combination of Blowfish and S\+H\+A-\/512.

See \href{http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/bcrypt-pbkdf}{\tt this article} for further information.

Parameters\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily pass}, a Uint8\+Array of length {\ttfamily passlen}
\item {\ttfamily passlen}, an integer Number
\item {\ttfamily salt}, a Uint8\+Array of length {\ttfamily saltlen}
\item {\ttfamily saltlen}, an integer Number
\item {\ttfamily key}, a Uint8\+Array of length {\ttfamily keylen}, will be filled with output
\item {\ttfamily keylen}, an integer Number
\item {\ttfamily rounds}, an integer Number, number of rounds of the P\+B\+K\+DF to run
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{{\ttfamily bcrypt\+\_\+pbkdf.\+hash(sha2pass, sha2salt, out)}}

Calculate a Blowfish hash, given S\+H\+A2-\/512 output of a password and salt. Used as part of the inner round function in the P\+B\+K\+DF.

Parameters\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily sha2pass}, a Uint8\+Array of length 64
\item {\ttfamily sha2salt}, a Uint8\+Array of length 64
\item {\ttfamily out}, a Uint8\+Array of length 32, will be filled with output
\end{DoxyItemize}
