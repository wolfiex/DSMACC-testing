# d3-save-svg

 A fork of the nytimes [svg-crowbar](http://nytimes.github.io/svg-crowbar/) bookmarklet that extracts SVG nodes and accompanying styles from an HTML document and downloads them as an SVG file --- A file which you could open and edit in Adobe Illustrator, for instance. Because SVGs are resolution independent, itâ€™s great for when you want to use web technologies to create documents that are meant to be printed (like, maybe on newsprint). It was created with [d3.js](https://d3js.org) in mind, but it should work fine no matter how you choose to generate your SVG.
