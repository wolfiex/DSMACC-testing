## Prerequisites:
 - installed KPP (../kpp/bin/kpp)

## Inventory

This folder contains the following files
 - gckpp.kpp: contains kpp syntax to build a dsmacc model with GEOS-Chem
 - tropchem.kpp: (default) enables tropchem.eqn and tropchem.spc
 - tropchem.spc: v11-01 tropchem species
 - tropchem.eqn: v11-01 tropchem equations
 - ucx.kpp: enables ucx.eqn and ucx.spc
 - ucx.spc: v11-01 UCX species
 - ucx.eqn: v11-01 UCX equations
 - geoschem_init.dat: initial conditions for a simple simulation
 - Makefile: a file with instructions on how to build and run the model.

## Instructions

To build and run the model, type "make" in a linux terminal
  $ make

The makefile will build the model (geoschem) and run it with initial
conditions from geoschem_init.dat. This will produce four outputs:
 - geoschem_conc_1.dat: concentrations in ! delimited format
 - geoschem_rate_1.dat: reaction rates in ! delimited format
 - geoschem.log: output log for warnings and/or errors
 - geoschem_conc_1.dat_O3.png: time series of ozone

## Switch to tropchem
## GEOS-Chem with FAST-JX Photolysis

1. Uncomment out INCLUDE ../geoschem.kpp
2. Add X before N2 and O2 in geoschem_init.dat
3. Run make clean; make all
